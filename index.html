					<td>lex O'Connor, also known as Rex Orange County, is a gifted singer/songwriter known for his literate, quirky brand of bedroom pop that combines jazz, hip-hop, and soul influences. O'Connor was still a teenager when he first gained attention online in 2015 for his self-produced album bcos u will never b free. He built upon his viral buzz with 2017's Apricot Princess, which found him further expanding his sound. The album cracked the Top Ten of Billboard's Independent Albums chart, and paved the way for his even more ambitious, jazz-inflected 2019 effort PONY. In 2022 O'Connor issued his fourth full-length outing, Who Cares?</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Born in 1998 and raised in the village of Grayshott along the border of Hampshire and Surrey, O'Connor grew up singing in the school choir and developed a love of pop, listening to a mix of classic and contemporary artists including Queen, Stevie Wonder, Green Day, and Weezer. A self-taught drummer, he gained entrance to the BRIT School in London as a teenager. While studying there, he also sang and played guitar, and picked up piano and production software skills while working on his first album. At 17, with the "O.C." derived from O'Connor, he used the Rex Orange County moniker to self-release bcos u will never b free for streaming in 2015.</td>
